# Adding-Labels-to-a-Dataset-for-Sentiment-Analysis

- Adding labels to a dataset is very important before you can use it to solve a problem. One of those problems where adding labels to a dataset is very important is sentiment analysis, where you get the data as reviews or comments from users, and you need to add labels to it to prepare it for sentiment analysis.
- To add labels to unlabeled data for sentiment analysis, we can use the Vader sentiment model which is one of the best approaches for sentiment analysis. We can access it using the NLTK library in Python.
